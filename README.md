# Data Science Projects 🚀

## 👋 Introduction
Hi, my name is **Aman Sharma**.  
I am preparing for a **Data Scientist role**, and this repository is a collection of my learning and hands-on projects throughout my journey.  
So far, exploring **Data Science** has been an exciting and rewarding experience, and I’m documenting my progress here.
